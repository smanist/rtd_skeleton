# Interactive Example

This page demonstrates the reusable interaction infrastructure. The Markdown
contains only a semantic placeholder; the controls and plot are created in
`docs/_static/js/examples/demo-plot.js`.

## Demo Plot

:::{course-interactive}
:data-example: demo-plot
Interactive example loading...
:::

## Python-backed Demo

:::{course-interactive}
:data-example: python-demo
Interactive example loading...
:::

## Implementation Notes

Each example initializer receives the placeholder element, reads optional
configuration from `data-*` attributes, and renders into that element. Shared
helpers for controls and lazy-loaded libraries are available on
`window.CourseInteractives`. Python-backed examples may keep source files under
`docs/_static/py/examples/` and load them through Pyodide when served over a
local HTTP server.

## Summary

Interactive examples stay as small semantic placeholders in chapter Markdown,
with behavior implemented in static JavaScript files and initialized by
`window.CourseInteractives`.
