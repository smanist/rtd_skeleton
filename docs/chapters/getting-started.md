# Getting Started

This placeholder chapter shows the basic structure for course content.

## Math

Use MyST math fences for display equations:

```{math}
:label: eq:sample-ode

\ddf{x}{t} = f(t, x).
```

You can reference the equation with {eq}`eq:sample-ode`.

## Folded Derivations

Use `foldbox` for detailed derivations that should be collapsed by default:

````md
:::{foldbox} Detailed derivation

Starting from the perturbation $x = x^\ast + \delta x$,

```{math}
\delta \dot{x}
= \left.\ppf{f}{x}\right|_{x^\ast} \delta x .
```

:::
````

Rendered example:

:::{foldbox} Detailed derivation

Starting from the perturbation $x = x^\ast + \delta x$,

```{math}
\delta \dot{x}
= \left.\ppf{f}{x}\right|_{x^\ast} \delta x .
```

## Figures

Keep reusable figures under `docs/pics/` or another documented static asset
folder, then reference them with MyST image or figure directives.

## Sections

Use one page-level heading per chapter. Use second-level headings for sections
and third-level headings for subsections so the generated sidebars remain tidy.

## Summary

This example page demonstrates ordinary MyST content, shared math macros,
folded optional detail, and the required `Summary` name for final chapter
summaries.
